Button Bar project
==================

This folder contains a minimal scaffold for the Button Bar PCB project.


What's included:

- `schematic/` — human-readable schematic sheets (placeholders) for top-level
  sheet, button matrix, and power/connectors.

- `components/` — symbol and footprint placeholders and notes for components

- `bom.csv` — a starter BOM template to be populated by the generator scripts

Next steps:

- Populate `components/symbols` with KiCad symbols or use `tools/scripts/gen_symbol.py`.

- Populate `components/footprints` with footprints or generate via `tools/scripts/gen_footprint.py`.

- Edit `schematic/*.sch.txt` to reflect the planned nets: VBUS/5V, VINT/3V3, GND,
  I2C/SPI/USB lines, matrix rows/cols, and any addressable LED power rails.

Concrete next steps
-------------------

- Populate `components/symbols` with KiCad symbols or generate them via
  `tools/scripts/gen_symbol.py` (see `tools/scripts/README.md` for usage).
- Populate `components/footprints` or generate with `tools/scripts/gen_footprint.py`.
- Edit `schematic/*.sch.txt` to wire the MCU to `matrix.sch.txt` nets: ROW0..ROW3,
  COL0..COL1, VBUS, VINT/3V3 and GND.
- Add or adapt `bom.csv` in this folder to list project parts. Run the project BOM
  generator to copy it into the canonical location and optionally enrich parts:

  - Copy project BOM to tools output:

    python generate_project_bom.py

  - Copy + run parts enrichment (requires API key in environment):

    python generate_project_bom.py --enrich

This repository already includes a starter `bom.csv` and a `schematic/matrix.sch.txt`
placeholder to help you iterate quickly.

Placeholders added
------------------

This project now includes placeholder symbol and footprint files under
`projects/button_bar/components/` to help early-stage netlist/placement work:

- `components/symbols/*.sch.txt` — human-readable symbol placeholders for U1,
  J1, switches, and diodes.
- `components/footprints/*.kicad_mod` — minimal footprint placeholders.

Replace these placeholders with real KiCad symbols/footprints generated by
`tools/scripts/gen_symbol.py` and `tools/scripts/gen_footprint.py` when you're
ready. The placeholders allow early-stage tooling (BOM, pinmap, netlist
templates) to iterate without final KiCad files.
