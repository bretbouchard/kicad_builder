Symbol placeholders
===================

Place symbol definitions or generated symbol files here. For rapid
iteration we use human-readable placeholder files (`.sch.txt`) that the
generators can later convert into KiCad symbol packages.

Common placeholders to add:

- RP2040 symbol (U1)

- USB connector (J1)

- Regulator (REG1)

- Discrete parts (R, C, D)
