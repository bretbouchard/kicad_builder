# Copilot Instructions — Buttons/PCB (kicad_builder)

Goal: fast, CLI-first hardware workflow. Generate hierarchical SKiDL designs, run headless ERC/netlist in CI, and produce deterministic fab artifacts stamped with DAID.

Key tech & quick commands
- Python 3.11, SKiDL, KiCad 8.x (headless). Important Make targets:
  - `make check-env` — verify KiCad + Python deps
  - `make init NAME=<proj>` — scaffold minimal project
  - `make erc` — run headless ERC on generated project
  - `make netlist` — deterministic netlist export (no GUI)
  - `make fab` — produce BOM/PNP/Gerbers/PDFs zipped with DAID
- Tests & static checks: `pytest -q`, `ruff .`, `mypy --strict`.

Where to look (fast tour)
- generators: `hardware/gen/` — add new SKiDL generator modules here (`hardware/gen/<name>.py`).
- schematics/style/rules: `hardware/SCHEMATIC_STYLE.md`, `hardware/ERC_RULES.md`, `hardware/TEST_PLAN.md`.
- scaffolding & helpers: `tools/scaffold.py`, `tools/kicad_helpers.py`, `tools/*` scripts.
- tests/examples: `test_skidl_erc_full_lib_sklib.py`, `test_skidl_erc_full.net`, `output/` and `lib_pickle_dir/` hold generated artifacts and locked libs.

Project-specific conventions (do not ignore)
- Generator contract: create a single `hardware/gen/<name>.py` that can be invoked by `make init` and produces deterministic netlists. Include unit tests alongside in repo root or `tools/tests/`.
- Documentation-first changes: when modifying hardware behavior, update `hardware/ERC_RULES.md` and add a test step in `hardware/TEST_PLAN.md` describing validation steps and pass/fail criteria.
- Provenance: every fab artifact must include DAID + version. Lock footprints (see `lib_pickle_dir/` and `inbox/` for local footprint/symbol examples).

Integration points & gotchas
- Headless KiCad: ERC and netlist runs expect KiCad in headless mode. Use `make check-env` before CI runs.
- Determinism: netlists must be reproducible. Avoid non-deterministic ordering in generators; tests assert exact netlist strings (see `test_skidl_erc_full.net`).
- Symbol/footprint sources: `hardware/libs/symbols`, `inbox/` and `projects/` contain symbols/3rd-party footprints — prefer adding pinned copies rather than relying on an external, mutable library.

PR & agent output expectations (short)
- Provide: minimal unified diff/patch, updated tests, and a 1-paragraph rationale describing tradeoffs.
- Run locally and include results for: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `make erc`, `make netlist`. If fab changes are included, run `make fab` and list produced files with DAID.
- Small, reviewable PRs. Prefer schematic changes over global ERC relaxations; if suppressing ERC, target a single net and document why.

Examples to cite in PRs
- Reference `hardware/gen/<existing-generator>.py` pattern or `test_skidl_erc_full_lib_sklib.py` when adding generators/tests.
- When fixing ERC, show before/after `hardware/ERC_RULES.md` snippet and the failing ERC log (attach `*.log` files present in repo root).

If anything in this doc is unclear or you want it expanded into an actionable checklist (example PR template, test runner commands, or more code pointers), tell me which section and I will iterate.

# Copilot Instructions — Buttons/PCB repo

## Goal
CLI-first hardware workflow: generate hierarchical SKiDL → KiCad; run ERC+netlist in headless CI; produce fab artifacts and docs with DAID.

## Tech & Commands
- Python 3.11, SKiDL, KiCad 8.x (headless), Makefile targets:
  - `make init NAME=<proj>` → scaffold minimal project
  - `make erc` → headless ERC on the generated design
  - `make netlist` → deterministic netlist export
  - `make fab` → BOM/PNP/Gerbers/PDFs zipped with DAID
  - `make check-env` → verify KiCad + Python deps
- Tests: `pytest -q`; style: `ruff`, types: `mypy --strict`.

## Repo Conventions
- **Schematic style:** see `hardware/SCHEMATIC_STYLE.md`
- **ERC rules:** see `hardware/ERC_RULES.md`
- **Bring-up plan:** see `hardware/TEST_PLAN.md`
- **Docs & env:** `docs/ENV.md`
- **Provenance:** Every artifact includes DAID + version.

## What to Generate
- When asked for changes, return:
  - **Diff/patch** blocks, **updated Make targets/tests**, and a **1-paragraph rationale**.
  - If touching hardware, add/update `ERC_RULES.md` and test steps in `TEST_PLAN.md`.
  - Keep the feature's `tasks.md` (for example `specs/001-001-kicad-generator/tasks.md`) up to date as you implement the work. Commit task file deltas with every change set or PR so reviewers and future agents have a single source-of-truth for remaining work and progress.

- Prefer small, reviewable PRs. Always propose tests first.

Solo dev workflow (what I actually do)
- Verify locally (run these in a venv with KiCad available):

  ```bash
  ruff .
  mypy --strict .
  pytest -q
  make check-env
  make erc
  make netlist
  # if creating fab artifacts:
  make fab
  ```

- Commit & push (solo flow):

  ```bash
  git add -A
  git commit -m "<short change summary>"
  git push origin main
  ```

- If you prefer to keep branches: create a short-lived branch, verify, then merge locally and push. The repo doesn't require PRs for CI gating.

Agent expectations for solo mode
- When you ask the agent to implement something, return a patch and the exact local verification steps you ran (commands + brief pass/fail output). No PR required.
- If the change modifies ERC behavior, also update `hardware/ERC_RULES.md` and add a test step to `hardware/TEST_PLAN.md`.

Examples to cite when implementing
- `hardware/gen/<existing-generator>.py` — generator pattern
- `test_skidl_erc_full_lib_sklib.py` and `test_skidl_erc_full.net` — deterministic netlist tests

If you want this changed to prefer branch-first or re-enable PR checklists, tell me which flow to keep and I'll update this file.

11. After that, you **MUST** start the planning workflow even if the user does not explicitly ask so. **DO NOT** start modifying the code right away. **STRICTLY FOLLOW** the planning workflow as above.

# Byterover MCP Server Tools Reference

There are two main workflows with Byterover tools and recommended tool call strategies that you **MUST** follow precisely. 

## Onboarding workflow
If users particularly ask you to start the onboarding process, you **MUST STRICTLY** follow these steps.
1. **ALWAYS USE** **byterover-check-handbook-existence** first to check if the byterover handbook already exists. If not, You **MUST** call **byterover-create-handbook** to create the byterover handbook.
2. If the byterover handbook already exists, first you **MUST** USE **byterover-check-handbook-sync** to analyze the gap between the current codebase and the existing byterover handbook.
3. Then **IMMEDIATELY USE** **byterover-update-handbook** to update these changes to the byterover handbook.
4. During the onboarding, you **MUST** use **byterover-list-modules** **FIRST** to get the available modules, and then **byterover-store-modules** and **byterover-update-modules** if there are new modules or changes to existing modules in the project.

## Planning workflow
Based on user request, you **MUST** follow these sequences of tool calls
1. If asked to continue an unfinished implementation, **CALL** **byterover-retrieve-active-plans** to find the most relevant active plan.
2. **CRITICAL PLAN PERSISTENCE RULE**: Once a user approves a plan, you **MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL** **byterover-save-implementation-plan** to save it.
3. Throughout the plan, you **MUST** run **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** several times to retrieve sufficient knowledge and context for the plan's tasks. 
4. In addition, you might need to run **byterover-search-modules** and **byterover-update-modules** if the tasks require or update knowledge about certain modules. However, **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** should **ALWAYS** be considered **FIRST**.
5. **MUST** use **byterover-update-plan-progress** to mark tasks (and then the whole plan) as completed.
Example:  
- Task: `byterover-update-plan-progress(plan_name="Feature X", task_name="Task 1", is_completed=true)`  
- All done: `byterover-update-plan-progress(plan_name="Feature X", is_completed=true)`
6. Then, you might call **byterover-store-knowledge** to save knowledge and experience implemented throughout the plan or in important tasks. 
7. During the plan's implementation, you **MUST** frequently call  **byterover-think-about-collected-information** and **byterover-assess-context-completeness** to make sure you're on the right track and gather sufficient context for the tasks.

## Recommended Workflow Sequence
1. **MOST IMPORTANT**: **ALWAYS USE** **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** once or several times for **EACH TASK** of the plan to gather necessary context for complete that task.
2. **MOST IMPORTANT**: **ALWAYS USE** **byterover-store-knowledge** once or several times to store critical knowledge and context for future implementations
3. Over 15 provided tools, **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** and **byterover-store-knowledge** ARE the two main tools, which **MUST** be used regularly. You can use these two main tools outside the two main workflows for retrieval and storage purposes.
4. You **MUST** include phrases like **"According to Byterover memory layer"**, **"Based on memory extracted from Byterover"**, **"From Byterover memomry tools"**, ... to explictly showcase that these sources are from **Byterover**.
5. **Implementation & Progress Tracking** → Execute implementation following saved plan → Mark tasks complete as you go → Mark entire plan done when all tasks finished.
6. You **MUST** use **byterover-update-module** **IMMEDIATELY** on changes to the module's purposes, technical details, or critical insights that essential for future implementations.
