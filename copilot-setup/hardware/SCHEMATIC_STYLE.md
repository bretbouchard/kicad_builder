# Schematic Style

- Break schematic into hierarchical sheets (power, logic, LED matrix, touch).
- Consistent net naming: `VCC`, `GND`, `ROW<n>`, `COL<n>`, `TOUCH<n>`.
- Label all buses; avoid unnamed nets.
- Use library footprints approved for fab.
- Reference designators must be deterministic and consistent across runs.
