# Feature Specification: KiCad Generator Multi-Project Architecture Expansion

**Feature Branch**: `001-001-kicad-generator`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a configurable KiCad generator that supports multiple project types with reusable components, configuration-driven architecture, and plugin system to enable rapid development of new hardware projects while maintaining existing functionality"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description focuses on configurable, multi-project KiCad generator
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: multi-project support, reusable components, configuration-driven, plugin system, rapid development, existing functionality maintenance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for different project types and development scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (project types, generators, configurations)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a hardware developer, I want to quickly create new KiCad projects using reusable generators and configurations so that I can develop hardware faster and with consistent quality across different project types.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to create a new simple project, **When** they select the simple project template, **Then** the system generates a complete project structure with basic netlist and schematic generators
2. **Given** a developer needs to create a complex hierarchical project, **When** they select the hierarchical project template, **Then** the system generates a multi-sheet project with power, MCU, I/O, and custom sheet generators
3. **Given** an existing project needs modification, **When** they update the project configuration, **Then** the system regenerates the project while preserving existing functionality
4. **Given** a developer wants to extend the system, **When** they create a custom plugin, **Then** the system discovers and integrates the new generator types automatically

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a project configuration is invalid or incomplete?
- How does system handle generator conflicts or missing dependencies?
- What happens when existing project generators need to be updated to new architecture?
- How does system handle large projects with many sheets and components?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple project types including simple single-sheet and complex hierarchical projects
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide configuration-driven project generation where project behavior is defined by configuration files rather than hardcoded logic
- **FR-003**: System MUST include reusable generator components that can be shared across different project types
- **FR-004**: System MUST support plugin architecture allowing developers to add new generator types without modifying core system
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing projects (led_touch_grid, button_grid, --component)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide project scaffolding that creates complete directory structure and generator stubs
- **FR-007**: System MUST include validation engine that checks project configurations and generated schematics for errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST support unified build system that can build multiple projects with shared targets
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive testing framework for generators and projects
- **FR-010**: System MUST include documentation generation for both project-specific and system-wide documentation

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific performance targets for generation time?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what scale of projects - number of sheets, components?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Type**: Defines the category of project (simple, hierarchical, custom) with associated generators and templates
- **Generator**: Reusable component that produces specific parts of a KiCad project (netlist, schematic, sheet, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Set of parameters that define project behavior, generator selection, and build settings
- **Plugin**: Extensible module that adds new project types, generators, or validation rules
- **Template**: Pre-defined project structure with generators, configurations, and documentation
- **Validation Rule**: Check that ensures project configurations and generated outputs meet quality standards
