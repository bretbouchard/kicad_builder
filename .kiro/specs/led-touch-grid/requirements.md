# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a modular LED capacitive touch button bar/grid system. The system will consist of tileable PCB modules that combine capacitive touch sensing with addressable RGB LEDs, controlled by RP2040 microcontrollers. The project uses a Python-based KiCad workflow for schematic generation, validation, and PCB design automation.

The system is designed for music and creative interaction applications, providing a large, scalable touch surface with visual feedback through programmable LEDs. Each tile contains an 8×8 grid of touch-sensitive pads with corresponding LED arrays, creating a seamless interactive surface when multiple tiles are combined.
