Vendor symbol libraries (minimal)

What this folder contains
- `REPO-MCU.lib` — minimal RP2040 symbol (pins: VCC, GND, GP0)
- `REPO-LEDs.lib` — minimal APA102 symbol (DATA, CLK, VCC, GND)
- `REPO-Device.lib` — PAD symbol
- `REPO-Power.lib` — VCC and GND power symbols
- `sym-lib-table` — a small KiCad symbol library table referencing the files above

Goal
These are minimal placeholder KiCad symbol libraries intended to make the
code-generated `.kicad_sch` files reference vendored libraries so they can be
opened reproducibly on your machine. They are not full-featured symbols yet —
think of them as the minimal skeletons to register in KiCad.

How to register these libraries in KiCad (local, GUI)
1. Open KiCad (version 6/7/9).
2. In the main window choose "Preferences → Manage Symbol Libraries".
3. In the "Project Specific Libraries" or "Global Libraries" tab click "Add".
4. In the file dialog, navigate to this repo's `tools/vendor_symbols` folder and
	select the library file you want to add (for example `REPO-MCU.lib`).
5. Repeat for the other files (`REPO-LEDs.lib`, `REPO-Device.lib`, `REPO-Power.lib`).
6. Close the dialogs. KiCad will now be able to resolve lib_ids like
	`REPO-MCU:RP2040` when opening schematics generated by the project.

How to register using the supplied `sym-lib-table` (quick import)
1. Open the same "Manage Symbol Libraries" dialog.
2. Use the "Import" button and select the `sym-lib-table` file included here.
	This will add all the vendored libraries at once.

Command-line / advanced
- You can also manually append the contents of `sym-lib-table` to your global
  `sym-lib-table` located in KiCad's configuration folder. Be careful — back up
  your existing table first.

Notes & next steps
- These are minimal placeholders. I can flesh out pin names, units and fields to
  better match the real RP2040 symbol and APA102 device if you want.
- After registering the libraries in KiCad, try opening `out/tile.kicad_sch` in
  KiCad; the symbols should resolve to the vendored libraries.
